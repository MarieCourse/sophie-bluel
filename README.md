## Overview

Project Mission during my training at OpenClassrooms.

### The mission

Deployed as a front-end developer to reinforce a team tasked with designing the portfolio website for an interior architect. My mission involves bringing dynamism to the site, with a focus on developing the architect's project presentation page. To achieve this, I retrieve data from the API, securely create the client's login page, and implement a modal for uploading new media.

## My process

### Built with

- Javascript
- API
- Forms

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I was able to acquire various skills in JavaScript, including fetching user data through forms, manipulating DOM elements to create a seamless and interactive user experience, handling user events, and mastering interaction with a bidirectional API.

### Useful resources

- [Modal window](https://grafikart.fr/tutoriels/modal-javascript-css-72) - This tutorial helped me create a modal window in JavaScript for the incorporation and deletion of elements from the database.

## Projet Launch

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/MarieCourse/sophie-bluel
```

If you want to display the code for the backend and frontend, do it in two separate instances of VSCode to avoid any issues.

### Launching the Frontend

Navigate to the 'FrontEnd' folder, and use LiveServer to preview the site en live.

### Launching the Backend

Open a new terminal and navigate to the 'Backend' folder :

1.Install NPM packages

```
npm install
```

2.Start the project

```
npm start
```

3. Login with test account

```
